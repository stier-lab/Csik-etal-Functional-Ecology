Bart's To Do: 

1. refit the metabolism X temperature models using celcius as a continuous following Erika's expectations listed in the paper

2. refit the metabolism X temperature models using K... Look at Vassar and McCann 2005 to figure out the Rall et al. convertion thing. 

3. extract the estimates for handling time for each temperature treatment, convert to max consumption rate, and fit the arrhenius equation
